I wanted to inform you that my uncle, who was unwell last time, has unfortunately become unwell again. As per the doctor's instructions, I am currently rushing to the hospital and need to take off now.

Regarding my updates from yesterday, I showed the test data to John and created two tables as per the Jira tasks. I was in the process of granting permissions to show them in the demo, but unfortunately, I cannot complete this now due to the emergency.
